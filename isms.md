# Isms
## Aims
- A flexible set up for patching
- But a clear idea of what everything is for
- Start with a basic patch that you can build from

## Basic patch
- Isms LFO is the master clock (for now)
- Clock into Teletype
- Teletype trigger out to Ansible clock in
  - OR clock Ansible from Teletype via ii (less reliable)
- Teletype is the only ii leader
- Teletype queries Kria CV
- The best way to get gates from Kria is via patch cables into Teletype
- Teletype uses the metro script to get FB values and send them to ER-301
