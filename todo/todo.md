I have an odd situation. When we moved in to our house in May 2020 I changed our gas/electricity supplier to Bulb. However, it turns out that only electricity had been transferred and that the gas supplier wasn't changed. We have only just noticed this. It would appear that we have been supplied with gas but have received no bills. I have now looked on 'Find My Supplier' and found that British Gas is still the supplier.

I am really worried about this and that we may owe a lot of money and I am looking for your help to resolve this situation.

Thank you,
