Hi Lyn,
How are things? Based on the emails I can't help but read things sound very busy.

I'm starting to feel a bit better, but I'm still finding the thought of work quite anxiety provoking.

The dose of anti-depressant I am taking was increased today and I'm starting to find conversations with the psychologist helpful. I am getting back into exercise which helps too.

I spoke to the GP yesterday and I have been signed-off until the end of my annual leave. If things continue to improve I would like to aim to come back after then, but to a phased return. I would like to think up some ideas about how that might work over the next week and then maybe we can discuss?

Thank you,
David
