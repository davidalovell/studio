1. What happened?
A few colleagues and myself I had dealings with the son of dementia patient who felt the care of his father had been poor. The son ultimately threatened legal action against me and refused to speak to me.

There were a number of medical issues including advancing dementia with poor insight and weight loss, a recent hospital admission with diarrhoea due to ischaemic colitis and pneumonia.

The son expressed concern that the weight loss had not been investigated. This had in fact been noted and a discussion about the relative merits of inveatigation was had with the patient and the daughter previously. I spoke to the daughter who remembered the discussion. Disapointingly I had not recorded this.

This was resolved with an MDT with the patient, wife, all his children, two care managers and myself. It was helpful to have this discussion as all the issues were explained and understood.

2. What did we do well?
The care of the patient in question I think was good overall, with careful involvement of the patient and the family members most involved with his care.

The MDT was also an extremely effective means of calming the situation and helping everyone to understand the situation in the same way. It also allowed for the family to have greater confidence in the quality of care that myself and the practice were providing.

3. What could we have done better?
The son was angry as I had not phoned him back specifically to discuss. This being said I had discussions with the other son and the daughter and had of course assumed that the information would be passed among the siblings. While it is not my duty to do this, I should have been more aware of the dissatisfaction of the first son.

Unfortunately, at the time this was taking place I was overwhelmed with workload and this certainly influenced how I responded to the situation.

4. Potential changes to practice
Aim to have high quality communication early in the process, in particular if there are relatives who have concerns.

Although MDTs can be time consuming, when they go well they can really help with a situation.
