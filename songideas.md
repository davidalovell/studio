# Song Ideas

## Slower song
- Song that is less busy
- Start with slow bass line
- Add some slow chords
- Slow repeated sequence
- ?Make this with a loop
- Flourishes of notes
- Drums - some open high hats
- Three parts:
- - Part 1: One chord for ages, then switch to another ?non-diatonic, then back
- - Part 2: Another chord sequence
- - Part 3: Outro to Blue Chicago Moon

## Song with a beat
- Beat using Digitone, a bit like noisetrees
- Bass sound (with hair a la Jogging House, but also sounds a bit like a double bass)
- Bass sometimes has fills, sometimes not
- ?Write a script that does this, similar to the way you used construct baslines on modular - one sequence is the main bassline - this is prioritised over another bassline which has a lot of probabilistic trigs to do, also polymetric
- Script does the following:
- - play seqA if not nil
- - play seqB if not nil and seqA is nil
- Some sparse digitone chords
- - Part 1: chords with bassline
- - part 2: same bassline but with reharmonised chords
- - part 3: add the snare (i have in my head that iron and wine song, how the drums come in only at the last section
- - stop all of a sudden
- can i work out a way to incorporate vocals?
