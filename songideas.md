# Song Ideas

## Slower song
- Song that is less busy
- Start with slow bass line
- Add some slow chords
- Slow repeated sequence
- ?Make this with a loop
- Flourishes of notes
- Drums - some open high hats
- Three parts:
- - Part 1: One chord for ages, then switch to another ?non-diatonic, then back
- - Part 2: Another chord sequence
- - Part 3: Outro to Blue Chicago Moon

## Song with a beat
Elements
- Tonal rhythmic sound (a la noise trees)
- Plucked double bass sound
- Crunchy snare - minimal, at the end
- Flourashes of note that somehow fall into chords - I think this bit will either be straightforward, or quite hard to achieve
- 
- Bass drum
  - Digitakt
  - Tonal beat / bass drum using Digitakt
  - Make it the tonic note
  - Something ?saw toothed or ?wavetable like sound
  - Use a sample from blankforms
  - Variation through sample start modulation, envelope release modulation
  - Bit crush sound very slightly
  - Some variable distortion, using locked trigs
- Bass
  - Bass sound (with hair a la Jogging House, but also sounds a bit like a double bass)
  - Bass sometimes has fills, sometimes not
- Script
  - ?Write a script that does this, similar to the way you used construct baslines on modular - one sequence is the main bassline - this is prioritised over another bassline which has a lot of probabilistic trigs to do, also polymetric
  - Script does the following:
    - play seqA if not nil
    - play seqB if not nil and seqA is nil
- Some sparse digitone chords
  - Part 1: chords with bassline
  - part 2: same bassline but with reharmonised chords
  - part 3: add the snare (i have in my head that iron and wine song, how the drums come in only at the last section
  - stop all of a sudden
  can i work out a way to incorporate vocals?
- Consider using digitakt for sampled chords, or sampled flourishes of notes, play asynchronously
- Digitone for chords, or note flourishes
