# Tickler

## Process
### Sound collages
- Press record as soon as you have something you enjoy and then continue to record
- Build up a collection of general recordings rather than final songs
- Record samples into digitakt
- Record to norns tape
- Record to tape recorder
- Record direct to Live
- Spend a session collating recordings
- Build a collage in Live

### 'Live coded' songs
- Create some functions that start and stop various parts
- Call each function in order as a performance
- Record the song to norns tape 

### Earthsea/Morphagene
- Read docs and play
- Couple this with Morphagene
- Reverb
- Distortion
- Feed into Digitakt
- Write a helper document

## Setup
### Patchbay
- Connect mono output of mixer to inputs of OP-1/Isms via patchbay
- Connect Tascam recorder to patchbay
- Connect OM-1 to patchbay
- Connect SvO system to patchbay
- Connect Palette case to patchbay
- Plug in power to Palette case
- Reorganise Palette case 1u modules
- Try patching Timeline/Bigsky out to main mixer input channels for greater control over EQ
- Label patchbay

### Palette
- Reorganise Palette case 1u modules
- Fix i2c issues - try crow with one thing at a time
- Try with new txb
- Try a configuration with Ansible
- Try a configuration with Teletype

## Norns scripts
### Digitone midi controlled sequencer script
- Use digitone as a midi controller to influence the sequencer parameters, build that into the script for happy accidents

### Vox/Seq possibilities
- Simple norns interface for calling each new part
- Consider making Vox a parent object and then voices are private objects to vox (a bit like lattice)
- Consider making seq part of vox, a seq is automatically created when a vox is created, there is a function in vox to call its contained seq
