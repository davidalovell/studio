# Tickler

TIDY UP

## Process
### Sound collages
- Press record as soon as you have something you enjoy and then continue to record
- Build up a collection of general recordings rather than final songs
- Record samples into digitakt
- Record to norns tape
- Record to tape recorder
- Record direct to Live
- Spend a session collating recordings
- Build a collage in Live

### 'Live coded' songs
- Create some functions that start and stop various parts
- Call each function in order as a performance
- Record the song to norns tape 

### Earthsea/Morphagene
- Read docs and play
- Couple this with Morphagene
- Reverb
- Distortion
- Feed into Digitakt
- Write a helper document

## Setup
### Loose ends
- Get a usb power/data splitter for grid

### Patchbay
- Connect mono output of mixer to inputs of OP-1/Isms via patchbay
- Connect OM-1 to patchbay
- Try patching Timeline/Bigsky out to main mixer input channels for greater control over EQ
- Label patchbay

### Palette
- Try a configuration with Ansible
- Try a configuration with Teletype

## Norns scripts
### Digitone midi controlled sequencer script
- Use digitone as a midi controller to influence the sequencer parameters, build that into the script for happy accidents

## Vox/Seq
- Check beat
- Check offset, there is a bug
- Build in crow support 
- Add comments to help with how to use user properties
- Add comments to say you need a nil handler in vox.action

- ?Add seq.return_on (to complement seq.action_on and seq.advance_on)
- This could integrate with seq.skip and seq.prob but may require a rewrite
  
- Save vox, seq as github libs and leave alone
- Save these in their own folder on norns
- Read docs on how to include lib not in folder on norns

### Vox/Seq rewrite
- Consider making Vox a parent object and then voices are private objects to vox (a bit like lattice)
- Consider making seq part of vox, a seq is automatically created when a vox is created, there is a function in vox to call its contained seq

## Tape organisation system
- Storage box for blank tapes
- Storage box for recorded tapes
- Write on cassette and cassette case
  - Date, recording, key, tempo

## Music theory
- Lydian chromatic concept

## Pedals
- Read Timeline manual
- Read Boum manual

## FXaid
- Plan presets for FXaid again 
- Try a few out and then upload a few simple ones in that you can learn 
- More reverb effects! 

## Mutable System
- Write a helper document

## Mac
- Ableton Live course
- Crow and Live link
- Crow and M4L

## Fix
- Tascam-424
- Marantz PMD-222 #2

## Sell
- Maths
- Teletype
- Ansible

### Soundcloud
- Tidy up page
- Better photos
- Just a block of colour at the top?

 ## Norns studies
- Make use of params
- Use a simplified vox
- Use sequins
- Ability to add voices from params
- OR do I want to work on using softcut?

## Next song
- Use switching sequencer script
- Try sequencing seq.action_on
- Try sequencing seq.advance_on

- Start with a lead line this time
- Bass sequence to suggest chords
- Play minor pentatonic starting from the major 3rd degree of a major 7th chord
- Play minor pentatonic starting from the major 7th degree of a major 7th chord
- construct a pentatonic scale using mask function to keep everything in key

- Use ER-301 sample player or FX unit
- Bring in the Mutable system as below

## Isms system exploration
- Use ER-301 as a mixer
- Sequencing combinations
  - Norns + Crow
  - Kria
  - Teletype

## Mutable system exploration
- Use 3 channels of Yarns for sequences
- Use 4th channel as the clock
- Use Marbles to generate more sequences from the initial sequences from Norns

## TSNM system exploration
- Patch and explore
- Learn TSNM live settings
- Learn TSNM sequencer mode
- Record loops by hand, improve your timing
- Practise sound-on-sound loops
- Practise layering loops that slowly fade out
- Clocked delays
