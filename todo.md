# To do

## Next
- Work on TSNM case script
- Work on switching sequencer

## Later
- Work on Vox/Seq
- Earthsea/Morphagene learning

## Email
Timeline:
Updated to crow 3.0
When uploading script had to restart crow for it to run
Downgrading to 2.0 meant this worked again
Then only able to communicate with w/ in synth mode
then crow constantly saying connected



## TSNM helper script
- input[1]: cv
- input[2]: gate
- output[1]: clock
- output[2]: lfo: use triple attenuator
- output[3]: lfo
- output[4]: lfo
- txi.input[1]: left = off/ reset, centre = start, right = clear scale
- txi.input[2]: tempo
- txi.input[3]: bass pattern
- txi.input[4]: w/ pattern
- txi.param[1]: bass: 0-1 = off, 1-9 = volume
- txi.param[2]: lead: 0-1 = off, 1-9 = volume - ?create your own way of cycling notes
- txi.param[3]: harmony: 0-1 = off, 1-9 = volume
- txi.param[4]: w/: 0-1 = off, 1-9 = volume

## Switching sequencer script
- Work on switching sequencer idea
- Document different ways of doing it
- Try sequencing seq.action_on
- Try sequencing seq.advance_on
- Bass sequence to suggest chords
- Play minor pentatonic starting from the major 3rd degree of a major 7th chord
- Play minor pentatonic starting from the major 7th degree of a major 7th chord

## Vox/Seq
- Add comments to help with how to use user properties
- Add comments to say you need a nil handler in vox.action
- ?Add seq.return_on (to complement seq.action_on and seq.advance_on)
  - This could integrate with seq.skip and seq.prob anbut may require a rewrite
- Save vox, seq as github libs and leave alone
- Save these in their own folder on norns
- Read docs on how to include lib not in folder on norns

## Earthsea/Morphagene
- Read docs and play
- Couple this with Morphagene
- Reverb
- Distortion
- Feed into Digitakt
- Write a helper document
