# To do

## Next
- Norns studies

- Next song

- Isms system exploration
- Mutable system exploration
- TSNM system exploration

- Work on website

## Norns studies
- Make use of params
- Use a simplified vox
- Use sequins
- Ability to add voices from params
- OR do I want to work on using softcut?

## Next song
- Use switching sequencer script
- Try sequencing seq.action_on
- Try sequencing seq.advance_on

- Start with a lead line this time
- Bass sequence to suggest chords
- Play minor pentatonic starting from the major 3rd degree of a major 7th chord
- Play minor pentatonic starting from the major 7th degree of a major 7th chord
- construct a pentatonic scale using mask function to keep everything in key

- Use ER-301 sample player or FX unit
- Bring in the Mutable system as below

## Isms system exploration
- Use ER-301 as a mixer
- Sequencing combinations
  - Norns + Crow
  - Kria
  - Teletype

## Mutable system exploration
- Use 3 channels of Yarns for sequences
- Use 4th channel as the clock
- Use Marbles to generate more sequences from the initial sequences from Norns

## TSNM system exploration
- Patch and explore
- Learn TSNM live settings
- Learn TSNM sequencer mode
- Record loops by hand, improve your timing
- Practise sound-on-sound loops
- Practise layering loops that slowly fade out
- Clocked delays
