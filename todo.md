# To do

## Next
- Build script that uses vox, seq, s and lattice
- Use digitone as a midi controller to influence the sequencer parameters, build that into the script for happy accidents

# Process
- Use norns as a sequencer for ideas, but use digitakt or digitone as a way to record the sequences
- Save different sequences in different patterns, this would be a good way to build songs
- Use digitakt to record little samples of music made
- Just remember to save the songs in a meaningful way for later
- Start a song that is less busy ([songideas.md](songideas.md))
- Keep tempo the same, and just record some stuff into norns
- Import and build up a collage in Live

## Script
- Simple norns interface for calling each new part
- Consider making seq part of vox, a seq is automatically created when a vox is created, there is a function in vox to call its contained seq
- Consider making a grand unified vox,seq,sequins,lattice

## Recording
- Turn on norns tape or recorder or Live
