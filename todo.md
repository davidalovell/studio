## Switching sequencer song

## TSNM system exploration
- Patch and explore
- Learn TSNM live settings
- Learn TSNM sequencer mode
- Record loops by hand, improve your timing
- Practise sound-on-sound loops
- Practise layering loops that slowly fade out
- Sync'ed delays

## Isms system exploration
- Use ER-301 as a mixer
- Sequencing combinations
  - Teletype
  - Teletype + Kria
  - Norns + Crow
  - Norns + Crow + Kria
  - Norns + Crow + Earthsea

## Switching sequencer script
- Document different ways of doing it
- Try sequencing seq.action_on
- Try sequencing seq.advance_on

- Simple norns/grid interface for calling each new part

- Bass sequence to suggest chords
- Play minor pentatonic starting from the major 3rd degree of a major 7th chord
- Play minor pentatonic starting from the major 7th degree of a major 7th chord

## Vox/Seq
- Build in crow support 
- Add comments to help with how to use user properties
- Add comments to say you need a nil handler in vox.action

- ?Add seq.return_on (to complement seq.action_on and seq.advance_on)
- This could integrate with seq.skip and seq.prob but may require a rewrite
  
- Save vox, seq as github libs and leave alone
- Save these in their own folder on norns
- Read docs on how to include lib not in folder on norns

## Website
