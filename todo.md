# To do

## Next
- A couch setup with norns and digitakt, digitoen
- Use norns as a sequencer for ideas, but use digitakt or digitone as a way to record the sequences
- Save different sequences in different patterns, this would be a good way to build songs
- Just remember to save the songs in a meaningful way for later
- Start a song that is less busy ([songideas.md](songideas.md))

1. Make a bass patch
2. Somehow do some chords with digitone
3. Keep tempo the same, and just record some stuff into norns
4. Import and build something up in Live

## Script
- Also send clock to digitakt via usb
- Simple norns interface for calling each new part

## Recording
- Turn on norns tape or recorder or Live
