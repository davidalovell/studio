- Work on switching sequencer script
- Work on website
- Work on Vox/Seq

## TSNM system exploration
- Record loops by hand, improve your timing
- Use the arp in unlatched mode
- Learn TSNM live settings
- Learn how to use the TSNM sequencer
- Practise sound-on-sound loops

### Website
- home
  - add photo
- posts
  - add photo to first post
  - have a look through some audio and upload
- audio
  - media player with playlist of all audio
- about
  - write an about section
  - Instagram link
  - Soundcloud link

## Vox/Seq
- Add comments to help with how to use user properties
- Add comments to say you need a nil handler in vox.action
- ?Add seq.return_on (to complement seq.action_on and seq.advance_on)
  - This could integrate with seq.skip and seq.prob anbut may require a rewrite
- Save vox, seq as github libs and leave alone
- Save these in their own folder on norns
- Read docs on how to include lib not in folder on norns

## Isms set up
