# To do

## Next
- Play around and come up with an idea for a performance
- Create some functions that start and stop various parts
- Call each function in order as a performance
- Record the song again in the same way

## Switching sequencer script
- Work on this idea

## Vox/Seq
- Fix the way vox handles user
- Save vox, seq as github libs and leave alone
- Save these in their own folder on norns
- Use digitone as a midi controller to influence the sequencer parameters, build that into the script for happy accidents

## Palette case
- Reorganise

## Astrabel.org
- Link that to soundcloud for now
- Some sketches

## Process
- Use norns as a sequencer for ideas    
- Use digitone to record the sequences
- Save different sequences in different patterns
- Build up songs
- Save the digitone songs in a meaningful way

## Recording
- Press record as soon as you have something you enjoy and then continue to record
- Build up a collection of general recordings rather than final songs
- Record samples into digitakt
- Record to norns tape
- Record to tape recorder
- Record direct to Live
- Spend a session collating recordings
- Build a collage in Live
