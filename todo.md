# To do

## Next
- Work on seq again as a division/skip sequences
- Use digitone as a midi controller to influence the sequencer parameters, build that into the script homehow for happy accidents

# Process
- Use norns as a sequencer for ideas, but use digitakt or digitone as a way to record the sequences
- Save different sequences in different patterns, this would be a good way to build songs
- Just remember to save the songs in a meaningful way for later
- Start a song that is less busy ([songideas.md](songideas.md))
- Keep tempo the same, and just record some stuff into norns
- Import and build something up in Live

## Script
- Simple norns interface for calling each new part

## Recording
- Turn on norns tape or recorder or Live
