# To do

## Next
- Start a second song part
- Save vox, seq as github libs and leave alone
- Read Timeline manual
- Read 

## Script
- Use digitone as a midi controller to influence the sequencer parameters, build that into the script for happy accidents
- Simple norns interface for calling each new part

## Palette case script
- Script that you play without the computer
- Script that uses a basic version of vox and seq
- Sequences are from TSNM
- TXi params generate harmony
- TSNM
- 16n fb interval bank

## Process
- Use norns as a sequencer for ideas
- Use digitone to record the sequences
- Save different sequences in different patterns
- Build up songs
- Save the digitone songs in a meaningful way

## Recording
- Press record as soon as you have something you enjoy and then continue to record
- Build up a collection of general recordings rather than final songs
- Record samples into digitakt
- Record to norns tape
- Record to tape recorder
- Record direct to Live
- Spend a session collating recordings
- Build a collage in Live
