# To do

## Next
- Build script that uses vox, seq, s and lattice
- Use digitone as a midi controller to influence the sequencer parameters, build that into the script for happy accidents

# Process
- For a new song, create a new github branch
- Use norns as a sequencer for ideas, but use digitone to record the sequences
- Save different sequences in different patterns
- Save the digitone songs in a meaningful way

# Sound collages
- Use digitakt to record little samples of music made
- Record things to norns tape
- Keep tempo the same (or don't)
- Import and build up a collage in Live

## Script
- Simple norns interface for calling each new part
- Consider making seq part of vox, a seq is automatically created when a vox is created, there is a function in vox to call its contained seq
- Consider making a grand unified vox,seq,sequins,lattice

## Recording
- Turn on norns tape or recorder or Live
