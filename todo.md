# To do

## Next
- Build script that uses voice, sequins and seq
- Use digitone as a midi controller to influence the sequencer parameters, build that into the script for happy accidents

# Process
- Use norns as a sequencer for ideas, but use digitakt or digitone as a way to record the sequences
- Save different sequences in different patterns, this would be a good way to build songs
- Use digitakt to record little samples of music made
- Just remember to save the songs in a meaningful way for later
- Start a song that is less busy ([songideas.md](songideas.md))
- Keep tempo the same, and just record some stuff into norns
- Import and build up a collage in Live

## Script
- Simple norns interface for calling each new part

## Recording
- Turn on norns tape or recorder or Live
