# To do

## Next
- Make a third chord
- Come up with an idea for a performance
- Record the song again in the same way
- Make a simplified bass part for part 1
- Read Timeline manual
- Read Boum manual

## Script
- Save vox, seq as github libs and leave alone
- Use digitone as a midi controller to influence the sequencer parameters, build that into the script for happy accidents
- Simple norns interface for calling each new part

## Crow script idea
- Script that you play without the computer
- Script that uses a basic version of vox and seq
- Note sequences are from TSNM
- TXi params generate harmony
- Sample and hold incoming notes
- param 1 determines rate of sampling
- param 2 determines transposition

## Process
- Use norns as a sequencer for ideas
- Use digitone to record the sequences
- Save different sequences in different patterns
- Build up songs
- Save the digitone songs in a meaningful way

## Recording
- Press record as soon as you have something you enjoy and then continue to record
- Build up a collection of general recordings rather than final songs
- Record samples into digitakt
- Record to norns tape
- Record to tape recorder
- Record direct to Live
- Spend a session collating recordings
- Build a collage in Live
