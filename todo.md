# To do

## Next
<!-- - Take the midi function out of .synth() and but in general code -->
<!-- - Take the :action() out of .synth() -->
<!-- - Change :play() so it calls :action(), then .synth() -->
<!-- - Change :play() so it returns note value -->
- Add 'clock.wait' function to synth and implement for vox.division
- Try using vox without seq
- Use musicitil instead of mask
- Save vox, seq as github libs and leave alone

## Script
- Use digitone as a midi controller to influence the sequencer parameters, build that into the script for happy accidents
- Simple norns interface for calling each new part

## Process
- Use norns as a sequencer for ideas
- Use digitone to record the sequences
- Save different sequences in different patterns
- Build up songs
- Save the digitone songs in a meaningful way

## Recording
- Press record as soon as you have something you enjoy and then continue to record
- Build up a collection of general recordings rather than final songs
- Record samples into digitakt
- Record to norns tape
- Record to tape recorder
- Record direct to Live
- Spend a session collating recordings
- Build a collage in Live
