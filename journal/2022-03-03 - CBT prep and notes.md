# CBT session 2 - prep and notes
# Triggers
1. When thinking about a new task
eg. texting someone back
what will they think about my reply?

2. When thinking about an outstanding task, or list of outstanding tasks
I struggle to keep all the tasks in my head at once
I keep flitting from thinking about each task without being able to devote my 

3. When I feel there is an expectation of me to do something
eg. from my wife

4. When something goes wrong
My son hasn't listened to me or not done what he has been asked
I catastrophise and start to think that that the whole day is ruined
It is not his fault, I know this, so I blame myself

Something minor  eg. dropped receipts my wife needed
In the end I made the right decision to go back and get them
But I panicked when I realised I had done this
And briefly considered not doing anything about it
Because what if I didn't find them
I'd have to speak to someone in the shop about it
But who should I speak to?
What if 


# Other observations
1. When I consult I worry when I get the sense that the person is not completely satisfied by the end of the consultation. I have trouble saying no to requests to discuss additional problems.
2. I often feel like I have missed something, or missed the point. I then worry about this.
3. I'm usually able to appear outwardly calm, most of the time
4. I tend to want to seek approval of others


# Growing up
Parents quite critical, at multiple small things: 'oh, you've done it like that'
Secondary school difficult, until I started making more friends after S4
I wasn't good at applying myself at school
I think my parents found that really frustrating
Enjoyed art at school
High expectations - medicine, dentistry, law, engineering
Chose medicine
Was eventually able to work hard enough to get the grades
 
Dad would struggle to let me do things myself and would often take over

Went to uni in aberdeen
Made some great friends
Struggled to apply myself again
Resat many exams
Met my future wife
She helped me to find enjoyment in medicine

Then did GP training
Again, quite tough in terms of volume of work required outwith clinical work
Great mentor, she helped me to excel

Got a job at my training practice
Also got a teaching role
But
