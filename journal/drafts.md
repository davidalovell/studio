## Things to say to Lyn
I saw your email about sustainability loan
Well done, thank you for arranging
I will look at this over the next few days

### Home
Calmer when I am at home
More present when I am with Alasdair
Able to spend more time thinking about my family

### Work
I am still panicked when I think about work:
Coming through the door and speaking to people - this is normal
Hearing about patients' problems - this is a problem

Thinking about unexpected daybook messages that I may not have time to deal with
Being unable to concentrate in the time between consultations, writing up etc.

A feeling that I can't do it
A feeling that I won't be able to juggle consulting with all the other practice stuff that needs to be thought about, emails, CPD

A thought that if I go back and crumble again then I will have to do the right thing by the practice and resign

I want to be back, but I can't work out if I am well enough yet

### Fix David group
Do you know what they have been speaking about?
I hear that Graeme and Ewan were keen to call me at some point
I would be happy for this to happen
But it would be good to arrange times first

### What will work look like
When coming back I won't be able to go to consulting straight away
Maybe start with some projects to build up some enthusiasm and confidence
Maybe doing docman, or prescriptions
Then as a third assist person for sessions, or parts of sessions
Then slowly build up the number of surgeries I do - I suspect any setbacks or difficult consultations are likely to hit me quite hard
Then second assist

### Outcome of call
Call Lyn next week for an update
Happy for me to come back to do projects at first
Why not just come in for a coffee some time - this is a really good idea



## CBT thought record ideas
Going for a walk with Stephen
Hearing about what might be happening at work i.e. people who want to call me
Hearing about patients' problems
Chat with Lyn
Lying awake at night thinkimg 'i hate everything about myself'
Thinking about things in the past, like a residential course, but only the negative parts





## Thoughts tonight 4/4/22
Lynn thinks I am pathetic
Lynn thinks I should just go back to work
Mind reading
Emotional reasoning

## Thought overnight 6/4/22
The way I consult people who present with insomnia is dismissive

The way I see patients is that they want something out of me

Is this what I actually think?

I can't face the idea of someone asking me to do something probably unnecessary, how do i say no? 

Everyone is better at music than me

Everyone is more confident to show off their music on lines

Everyone thinks I am no good on lines

Lynn thinks my synths are a massive waste of money

My synths are a massive waste of money

I am very selfish in buying this stuff

All the music I make is rubbish

No it isn't


I was thinking about a mock interview I did in 2011, the interviewer seemed not to like me, I then said 'i hate myself'


seeing Laura at the cinema
Feeling panicked
i wish i had stayed at home

Thinking about consulting, I'm going to struggle to listen to patients with multiple unexplained problems

These patients will sap me dry

Lynn expected me to make her tea and I didnt, she thinks I am wasting time

Lynn thinks I have eroded her evening because I didnt get Alasdair to bed early enough

Lynn hasn't really spoken to me this evening so she must think I am rubbish

I do much more of the housework than Lynn

Aileen will think i am skiving when Lynn goes to the medication reviews

lynn didnt say good morning so she must hate me

i asked lynn about a meeting that i had misremembered was this afternoon, it was next week
she must think i dont listen to her

alasdair took a long time to get ready
lynn must think i am not firm and a bad parent

lynn has a flat tyre
i am a failure

mornings will not work when we arent working 
    
## Next

I know too little to be a gp
Thoughts on my run about dad and the practice
Thoughts about Lynn thinking I am rubbish while out in Stonehaven
Thoughts about what lynn said in the garage about the mouse
thoughts when lynn didnt help to tidy up
thoughts when i couldnt say how i felt
tgoughts when i awoke in the morning - i am going to disappear

talking about the plans over the next few weeks
panic
