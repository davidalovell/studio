# Mental filter
I cannot think of specific examples, but I used to do this very frequently. It would typically be situations where I thought I had been undermined in some way, in particular if I had an argument with Lynn.

I would feel very defensive. I would feel like I never won arguments. I felt that it was Lynn's fault and if she could just see things from my perspective then things would be better. I felt consistently critised.

When I reacted like this I would stew on these events for a long time, sometimes for days.

I do my best not to do this any more. I try to understand and try to anticipate Lynn's needs better. I have an awareness now that when she is stressed she thinks of all the things that we need to do.


# Personalisation
I was recently building something at home - an electronic musical instrument, I was building it from a kit. I was using a soldering iron. I was a bit anxious about it because the device is quite rare and if I made any mistakes the chance of me getting a replacement was nil.

It was getting late but I wanted to get it finished. I was putting in the finishing touches but I broke a component and as such it didn't work.

I then thought about the fact I had stayed up late to complete this, when I should have gone to bed early for the sake of my own mental health. 

I felt so angry with myself, I had wasted an opportunity to start feeling a bit better and now I was going go feel tired

I felt like I am my own worst enemy. I felt self hatred.

Later I was able to see the problem a little differently. I researched the component I had broken and found it was quite cheap. I came up with a plan to try different things in a measured way. After about a week of trying a few things I managed to get it to work.


# Black and white thinking


# Labelling


# Emotional reasoning
It was the last day I had at work. The day before I had had a conversation with my GP and an Occupational Health doctor. I had been advised to take time off, but I really wasn't sure. I had it in my head that I was going to work the folloqing day and then ask for a few days off. I was expecting that the day was going to be difficult.

When I got to work I looked at my list of tasks and completely froze. I could not see how I was going to complete any of those tasks.

I felt agitated and panicked.
