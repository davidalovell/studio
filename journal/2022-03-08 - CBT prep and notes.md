It was the last day I had at work. The day before I had had a conversation with my GP and an Occupational Health doctor. I had been advised to take time off, but I really wasn't sure. I had it in my head that I was going to work the folloqing day and then ask for a few days off. I was expecting that the day was going to be difficult.

When I got to work I looked at my list of tasks and completely froze. I could not see how I was going to complete any of those tasks.

I felt agitated and panicked.
