# Thought record
## Situation
The morning of Alasdair's and my day off together
We sat and watched I film while I filled in CBT forms
I felt anxious that I wasn't making great progress on the forms
I felt worried that I wasn't giving Alasdair enough attention despite me sitting next to him
I felt worried that I hadn't showered yet and we need to leave the house in 50 minutes for his football
I hadn't got him dressed yet
I hadn't brushed his teeth yet
He hates being rushed so I feel like I need to give him lots of time to get ready
But I feel like I haven't left enough time
