I went off work the day after I spoke to you
I had the intention of attempting to work that day, and perhaps take the week off
But when I looked at my list of tasks and list of patients that morning I froze
There was no way I could have safely worked that day
The thought of going back before I am ready terrifies me

I have had two sessions with psychologist (private)
Her take is that I have severe anxiety and moderately severe depression
There are a few things that triggers that I need to work on
In particular, being issued tasks is a major trigger for me, and I tend to overanalyse

I have been trying to exercise every 1-2 days - going for runs
I have been playing music

Looking for further med3 to cover until 28/03


He didn't call - did I get the day wrong


Hi there,
I was expecting a call from Dr. Tiwari today, but I may have written down the wrong day.

I was recently started on anti-depressants for stress/anxiety and I am currently signed off work. I have some resources to work through and have arranged to see a psychologist privately. I am doing my best to exercise several times per week.

I still feel anxious every day and small things can trigger physical symptoms of anxiety that can last for some time.

I have been on sertraline for nearly 3 weeks. I wondered if it would be appropriate to increase the dose to 100mg - let me know what you think.

I am not ready to return to work and was hoping to be signed off again from today until 28/03/2022.

Thank you,
