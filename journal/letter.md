Good Evening, 
I hope everyone is well.  I have just read a post online about the Forest Drive Park, beside Mill O' Forest School.  Aberdeenshire Council have concluded their findings in a report that recommends the rugby club have the asset transferred over to them.  Some of you may remember a petition going round and over 1100 residents objected to these proposals.  
This is our dedicated green space (as we were informed by SMH) and shortly children, dog walkers and Stonehaven residents will no longer have access to this.  
I am in favour of the rugby club finding more suitable premises but I feel this space is not best suited.  There will be a lot of traffic congestion on the road outside the park, children will only have the small play park to play in (with no vehicle access to the car park) and children walking to and from school will encounter more traffic/parked cars as a result.  w
The advice for those who object to these proposals is to email the councillors on the Kincardine and Mearns Area committee and why you are against it.  It certainly goes against Aberdeenshire Council’s vision: “Our vision is that all children and young people in Aberdeenshire will have accessible and inclusive opportunities to play everyday."

I have listed the councillors email addresses below:

Dear Councillor,

I am writing to you to express my opposition to the proposed asset transfer of Forest Drive Park, Stonehaven to the local rugby club.

I understand that a report has recently been completed which has recommended to councillors that this proposal is approved, despite the submission of a petition containing the signatures of 1100 local residents expressing their opposition.

I have a four-year-old son who is shortly due to start at Mill O'Forest Primary School (adjacent to the current park). As it stands, the park provides a large, open, and safe place for him to play and exercise after school. It is only a 5-minute walk from our house (0.2 miles) with only one road that needs to be crossed. The next nearest designated park space is Mineralwell Park which takes 30 minutes to walk to from our house (1.7 miles), and it is necessary to cross many busy roads to get there.

While I support the idea of a sustainable home for the rugby club, I believe the proposed asset transfer significantly disadvantages the local community while benefiting only the rugby club.

I grew up in Drumlithie, Aberdeenshire which has a large and open park. Playing there was an important part of my childhood and I want the same for my son and his peers.

I urge you to use your influence to oppose this plan.

Thank you,

Dr. David Lovell
