# To do

## Next
- Copy new lattice from https://github.com/monome/norns/blob/main/lua/lib/lattice.lua
- Make a skip and every action in lattice
- Make a version of sequins that has modulus setting for every, and hold function - minimal editing
- Integrate this with digitone
- Create functions that are called for each new musical part
- Build a song (AND SAVE IT AS A BRANCH WITH INSTRUCTIONS)

## Music
- Spend at least 10 minutes recording every session

## Script ideas
- Find or write a norns script that can co-ordinate USB midi for you
- Make Vox a parent object and then voices are private objects to vox (a bit like lattice) 

## Setup
- Fix ER-301
- Build Plinky

## Tickler
- [tickler.txt](../main/tickler.txt)
