# To do

## Next
- Make a skip action in lattice
- Integrate this with digitone
- Finalise and make it into a vox repo

## Music
- Create functions that are called for each new musical part
- Build a song (and save it as a branch)
- Spend at least 10 minutes recording every session

## Script ideas
- Find or write a norns script that can co-ordinate USB midi for you
- Make it so Vox can be passed a table k,v with any remainders passed to synth
- Make Vox a parent object and then voices are private objects to vox (a bit like lattice) 

## Setup
- Fix ER-301
- Build Plinky

## Tickler
