# Stress diary

Feeling overwhelmed by work, home, personal tasks
I get a really unpleasant feeling when I approach things that make me in any way uncomfortable
As such I often procrastinate, or bury problems
However, when I do this I am still thinking about the thing I need to do
But I know that doing it will make me feel even more uncomfortable (while I am doing it)
And because of this I end up doing the task really slowly, and unpleasant feeling stays for longer

I quite often find myself writing and rewriting sentenses, especially in referrals at work (this is why I can no longer dictate letters)
Or in text messages
Or in emails
I have always been like this, but now I find writing any one of these makes me feel very uncomfortable

There have recently been some things that have triggered these stressed thoughts.

In particular I saw a teenage patient and her mum when at a cafe on Sunday. At one point I had a backlog of twenty plus referrals to write and their referral was one of them. They had waited two weeks for the referral to be written. The mum had made an informal complaint and one of my colleagues (who was supporting me closely at the time) dealt with it for me.

Anyway, they sat behind me in the cafe. Rationally, I highly doubt that they knew it was me. But I couldn't get the thoughts of previous events out of my head, and the guilt and shame.

Another thing that triggered me tonight was a friend texting me again.

The back story is he was arrangign a friend's stag do and had asked us to keep a certain weekend free. I had not put this in my callendar and subsequenly my partner and I booked a holiday to start that weekend. I think I realised shortly after we booked it, but I did not tell anyone about this for weeks and weeks. I felt awful about this, but like the situations above I just burried it, but continued to worry about it.

I wasn't sure how I was going to explain this. I imagined that my friends would react really badly to it and I think at one point I had basically resigned myself to the idea that these friendships were essentially over.

I have another friend I hadn't texted back for ages. I feel awful about this too because she has been off work having had an operation. I kept wanting to text her to see how she was, but the longer I left it the more I felt I needed to give a really big explanation, which I thought would sound like a pathetic excuse for being a shit friend.
